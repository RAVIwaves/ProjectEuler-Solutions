# ProjectEuler-Solutions

This repository contains solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in C++. Each solution is designed to efficiently solve a given problem and outputs the answer when executed.

## About
This repository includes C++ solutions to various Project Euler problems. Each solution is organized by problem number and named according to the pattern `no._name.cpp` (e.g., `003_Largest_Prime_Number.cpp`). When run, each C++ program calculates and outputs the corresponding answer to the problem.

Additionally, the root directory contains an `answers.txt` file, which holds the numerical answers to each problem in the order they appear in the repository. This file allows you to quickly reference the answers without running the solutions.


## Usage
To view or run a solution:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ProjectEuler-Solutions.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory where the problem's solution file is located.

3. Compile and run the C++ code to get the answer.

Example for Problem 3:
   ```bash
   g++ 003_Largest_Prime_Number.cpp -o problem3
   ./problem3
   ```
